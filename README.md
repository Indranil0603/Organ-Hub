# Organ-Hub

<h2>Abstract</h2>
In the exponentially growing population of India, the demand never meets the supply. However, due to this reason one of the most afflicted industries in India is the Medical industry. There is only around 0.8 donors per million population. Therefore , to encourage more organ donation in India , this process has to be made hassle free. Moreover, if there is an urgent requirement of organs in an hospital and there is an acute shortage , then?

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Currently, in India a donor has to go through a very slow and inefficient process to fulfill such a noble cause. Moreover, the government sites are poorly designed with no proper UI/UX in the website to guide people through the procedure.</p>

<p>Also, there is no proper platform which helps hospitals to connect and help each other at times of emergencies or acute shortages of organs. There is also no dynamic database which tracks the lifespan of available organs, as all isolated organs have a death period.</p>

<p>Moreover, the non- governmental organizations who are striving to encourage people towards donation and such selfless acts need to be aided. Their purpose requires a lot of financial support and they need to be connected with the right people.</p>
